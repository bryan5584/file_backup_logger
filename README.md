# File Backup Logger

## Description

File Backup Logger is a Python application designed to back up files and folders with automatic versioning (timestamp), local logging of operations, and a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

The code is written using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for modularity and maintainability.
